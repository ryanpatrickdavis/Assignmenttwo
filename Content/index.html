        <h1>Playstation VR and Oculus Rift</h1>
        <p>
        Playstation VR, along with its rival The Oculus Rift is the future of gaming as we know it. Imagine a world where you are fully emersed within a game. In every direction that you look, all you see is the video game world you are inside. In a recent E3 conference, Playstation showed off their new advancements by putting players into a survival horror situation. <q cite="http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2015/07/03/how-technology-will-push-ps4-horror-games-forward-daily-reaction/#/slide/1">Somewhere, some creative director has a board full of ideas that are going to be the next horror thing that we are all talking about and we have no idea what we’re about to get into.</q> The game was described as not unlike "Saw" or "Hostel", showing that that whether it is survival horror, sports, or rpg's, this technology will shape the destiny of future gaming forever. This technology is so cutting age, even the medical industry is interested in its ability to perform virtual therapy, and physical therapy for people like amputee patients who are setup to recieve prosthetic limbs in the future. There is no doubt you will want to check out one of these in the future, the only question is which one? Lets compare the price, the visuals, and the performance of both of the machines.

        <p>
        When it comes to visuals, first we must explore both the outside and the inside. The Playstation VR, is clearly the more impressive of the two on the outside, the Oculus Rift has been described as more of a colored shoebox that you strap to your face. On the inside however, they are very similiary comparable. The Oculas has a <q cite="http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/oculus-rift-vs-playstation-vr/">2160 x 1200 total resolution across two displays, versus PlayStation VR’s 1920 x 1080</q>, giving the Rift a slightly sharper picture. However, these are expected to be suseptable to change by the time they are released around 2016, and anything could change between now and then. In addition, both include the use of very similiar headsets that seem to have very similar capabilities. The overall sound quality though might swing in Playstations favor.

        </p>
        <p> One of the first things you have to consider is the refresh rate. <q cite="http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/oculus-rift-vs-playstation-vr/">Both the Oculus Rift and PlayStation VR run at a 90Hz refresh rate per eye display, meaning there won’t be a major difference between the two headsets in terms of image movement fluidity.
</q> 
        Also, in relation to refresh rates, both systems are constantly battling issues with latency, which can cause motion sickness among virtual reality divers. This is because the game might process things slower than your brain, and then your mind has to try to process the difference in the world you're already immeresed inside. Hopefully by the time they are on shelves, this will no longer be much of an issue beyond the prototype phase. One of the easiest ways to compare the performance difference is the hardware they will be used with. The Playstation VR will be exclusive to the Playstation 4 console, while the Oculus Rift will be on PC. The playstation 4's specs are always the same, so there is no need to upgrade your console to be able to use the Playstation VR. The PC however, might need to be upgraded considerably to be able to handle the Oculus Rift, depending on an individuals rig. It has the potential to surpass the Playstation 4 components if you modified it enough.
        </p>
        <P> This leaves us just with cost. Since they are both still prototypes at this point, there isn't any official announcement on prices just yet. If you recall the hardware required to each is required to run on however, this tells us a different story. While some people may find the playstation 4 expensive (around $400), it is relatively cheap compared to the requirements of a PC to run its oculus rift. <q cite="http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/oculus-rift-vs-playstation-vr/">(the company said Rift-ready PCs will be offered by third-party partners starting around $1000).</q> By 2016, the price of a Playstation 4 may drop even lower, although with their strong sales it is hard to tell if they will.</P>
        <p>Finally, we are left with our decision yet again, which one to buy? Well even when we consider the prices, the performances, and the visuals, it still isn't an incredibly easy choice. In terms of sheer stats, the oculus rift seems to have a slight advantage in more areas. Since both systems ARE still in the prototype stage, it is still far too early to really make a call like this. Finally, one last thing to consider are the actual games. Oculus Rift has an advantage in quantity, with over 100 games already announced for its rather impressively growing library. The playstation VR might eventually win in quality, not in terms of resolution, but sheer enjoyment of the games it produces. It is a dedicated GAMING console, with a long history of extremely well-reviewed games for GENERATIONS now across MANY platforms (this just being the most recent one). The Oculus Rift creators on the other hand seem to always be saying things along the lines of "yeah, games are cool ... but imagine WHAT ELSE we could do with this technology". Not only that, but they lost some face-value in my eyes after they were bought-out by Facebook. In any case, no matter what happens, or who ends up being the best, these are extremely exciting times to live in as a gamer. I for once can't wait to see what these companies will produce.</p>
